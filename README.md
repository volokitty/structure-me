# structure-me
A program to create a file and folder structure for your projects directly from the context menu.
All you have to do is follow the installation instructions and configure the settings.json file to fit you. 
**Let's do it together! :smile:**

# Requirements
* Python 3.4+
* winreg library

# Installation
1. Run your terminal / cmd as administrator.
2. pip install winregistry
3. Locate the repository wherever you want.
4. cd *your-directory/structure-me/scripts/*
5. python reg.py

That's all about it :smiley:! Now you can set up the *settings.json* file.
